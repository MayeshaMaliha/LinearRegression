## Understanding the Standard Deviation of the Conditional Distribution

### **Formula:**
The standard deviation (SD) of **Y given X** is:

\[
SD(Y | X = x) = \sigma_Y \sqrt{1 - \rho^2}
\]

- **σ_Y** = Standard deviation of Y before considering X.
- **ρ (rho)** = Correlation between X and Y.
- The **square root part** shows how much the variability (spread) of Y decreases after considering X.

---

### **Why Does the Standard Deviation Decrease?**
- Before conditioning on X, the standard deviation is **SD(Y) = σ_Y**, meaning all values of Y are considered.
- After conditioning (e.g., looking only at sons of **72-inch-tall fathers**), the variation in Y **reduces**.
- Since the group is more **homogeneous**, there is **less randomness**, so the spread shrinks.

---

### **How Much Does It Reduce?**
- The reduction factor is **√(1 - ρ²)**.
- Example: If **ρ = 0.5**, then:

  \[
  1 - ρ^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
  \]

  \[
  \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.87
  \]

  - This means the new SD is **87%** of the original SD.
  - **Variability is reduced by 13%.**

---

### **What Does "X Explains Y’s Variability" Mean?**
- The fraction of **variance** explained by X is **ρ²** (correlation squared).
- Example: If **ρ = 0.5**, then:

  \[
  ρ^2 = 0.25 \quad (25\%)
  \]

  - This means **father’s height explains 25% of the variability in son’s height**.
  - The remaining **75%** is due to other factors like genetics, nutrition, and environment.

### **Important Condition:**
- The **"variance explained"** interpretation **only** makes sense if the data follows a **bivariate normal distribution**.
- If the data is **not normal**, the calculation might not be valid.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Conditioning on X reduces the spread (SD) of Y.**
- **The reduction factor is √(1 - ρ²).**
- **X explains ρ² (correlation squared) of Y’s variance.**
- **This only works when the data is approximately bivariate normal.**
