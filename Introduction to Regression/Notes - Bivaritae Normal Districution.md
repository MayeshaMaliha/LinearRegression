## Breaking It Down Simply

### **What Does This Formula Mean?**
The formula for the standard deviation (SD) of **Y given X** is:

\[
SD(Y | X = x) = \sigma_Y \sqrt{1 - \rho^2}
\]

- **σ_Y** = The standard deviation of Y (before considering X).
- **ρ (rho)** = The correlation between X and Y.
- The **square root part** shows how much the variability (spread) of Y decreases after considering X.

---

### **Why Does the Standard Deviation Decrease?**
- Before conditioning on X, **SD(Y) = σ_Y**, meaning we look at all possible values of Y.
- But if we **only consider cases where X has a specific value** (e.g., sons of **72-inch-tall fathers**), there is **less randomness** in Y (son’s height).
- Since the group is more **homogeneous**, the variation in son height **reduces**.

---

### **How Much Does It Reduce?**
- The reduction factor is **√(1 - ρ²)**.
- Example: If **ρ = 0.5**, then:

  \[
  1 - ρ^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
  \]

  \[
  \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.87
  \]

  - This means the new **SD is 87%** of the original SD.
  - **Variability is reduced by 13%.**

---

### **What Does "X Explains Y’s Variability" Mean?**
- The fraction of **variance** explained by X is **ρ²** (correlation squared).
- Example: If **ρ = 0.5**, then:

  \[
  ρ^2 = 0.25 \quad (25\%)
  \]

  - This means **father’s height explains 25% of the variability in son’s height**.
  - The remaining **75%** is due to other factors like **genetics, nutrition, and environment**.

---

### **Important Condition**
- The idea of **"variance explained"** **only works** if the data follows a **bivariate normal distribution**.
- If the data is **not normally distributed**, this interpretation might not be accurate.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Conditioning on X reduces the spread (SD) of Y.**
- **The reduction factor is √(1 - ρ²).**
- **X explains ρ² (correlation squared) of Y’s variance.**
- **This only works when the data is approximately bivariate normal.**
