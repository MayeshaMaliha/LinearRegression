## 1. What is a Bivariate Normal Distribution?
It describes the relationship between two variables that are both normally distributed.
When plotted, the data points look like oval-shaped clusters in a scatterplot.
If the variables are highly correlated, the oval is long and thin. If they are uncorrelated, the oval is more circular.
## 2. What Does This Mean for Correlation and Regression?
If two variables follow a bivariate normal distribution, their correlation is meaningful.
The regression line gives the best prediction of one variable based on the other.
The expected value (mean) of Y given X follows this formula:
# E(Y∣X=x)= μY​+ρ*(X−μX​)*σY​/σX​​
μ_Y, μ_X = Means of Y and X
σ_Y, σ_X = Standard deviations of Y and X
ρ = Correlation between X and Y
The slope of the regression line is:
ρσYσXρσX​σY​​
This shows how much Y changes for a unit increase in X.
## 3. Why Does This Matter?
If the data follows a bivariate normal distribution, regression is statistically valid.
This means that predicting Y from X using the regression line is optimal.
## 4. What’s the Practical Takeaway?
If your data is not bivariate normal, correlation and regression might not work well.
Always check whether your variables follow a normal distribution before making predictions.
